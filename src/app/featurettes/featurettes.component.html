        The academic program at Alphonsa School places an emphasis on every
        aspect of our studentâ€™s growth and development. We take advantage of the
        natural curiosity students possess by having our teachers present new
        information in creative ways and teach through exploratory experiences.
        Our I.C.S.E curriculum includes a variety of challenging courses that
        meet or exceed state requirements.
